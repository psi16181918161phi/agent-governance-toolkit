# AI Agent Impact Assessment Template

> **Purpose**: Structured template for assessing risks and impacts before deploying
> AI agents in high-risk environments. Aligns with Colorado AI Act (SB 21-169),
> EU AI Act Article 9, and NIST AI RMF MAP function.
>
> **Usage**: Complete this template for each agent deployment. Store completed
> assessments alongside the agent's policy YAML in version control.

## 1. Agent Identification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Agent Name** | |
| **Agent DID** | `did:agentmesh:...` |
| **Version** | |
| **Owner / Sponsor** | |
| **Deployment Environment** | ☐ Development ☐ Staging ☐ Production |
| **Assessment Date** | |
| **Assessor** | |
| **Review Due Date** | |

## 2. Purpose and Scope

### 2.1 Agent Purpose
_Describe what the agent does, what decisions it makes, and what actions it takes._

### 2.2 Target Population
_Who is affected by the agent's actions? Include both direct users and downstream affected parties._

### 2.3 Decision Types
| Decision | Consequential? | Reversible? |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| _e.g., Loan approval_ | ☐ Yes ☐ No | ☐ Yes ☐ No |

> **Consequential decisions** (Colorado AI Act): decisions that have a material
> legal or similarly significant effect on consumers in education, employment,
> financial services, healthcare, housing, insurance, or government services.

### 5.2 Fairness Testing
- Has the agent been tested for disparate impact? ☐ Yes ☐ No
- Testing methodology:
- Results summary:

### 5.3 Mitigation Measures
_Describe controls to prevent discriminatory outcomes._

## 6. Governance Controls

### 6.1 AGT Policy Configuration
```yaml
# Reference the agent's policy file
policy_file: policies/<agent-name>.yaml
extends:

- Is there a consumer-facing disclosure that AI is being used? ☐ Yes ☐ No
- Are audit logs accessible for review? ☐ Yes ☐ No

## 8. Incident Response

- Incident classification defined? ☐ Yes ☐ No (see [incident-response-workflow.md](incident-response-workflow.md))
- Rollback procedure documented? ☐ Yes ☐ No
