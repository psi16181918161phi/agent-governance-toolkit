"""Application factory for the Engine API reference adapter.

:func:`create_app` assembles a single :class:`fastapi.FastAPI` instance that exposes every
v1 Engine API route (contract section 7), each decorated with capability flags, wires the
section 10 error envelope, and applies :func:`inject_capability_extension` last so the
generated OpenAPI carries ``x-capability-flags`` on every operation.

This is the canonical reference adapter referenced by ``docs/studio/engine-api-contract.md``.
It is intentionally self-contained: one app, one process, one OpenAPI document.

    FastAPI 0.118+/Starlette 1.x changed :meth:`FastAPI.include_router` so it
    appends a single ``_IncludedRouter`` proxy to ``app.router.routes`` instead
    of flattening the sub-router's :class:`~fastapi.routing.APIRoute` objects
    into the app's route list. :func:`inject_capability_extension` iterates
    ``app.routes`` looking for top-level ``APIRoute`` instances, so routes hidden
    behind that proxy never receive their ``x-capability-flags`` extension (and,
    worse, the loop cannot tell they are missing). Appending each ``APIRoute``
    directly keeps every operation visible to the capability hook across all
    supported FastAPI versions. The route modules use plain, prefix-free routers
    with absolute ``/api/v1`` paths and per-route tags, so direct registration is
    equivalent to ``include_router`` here.
