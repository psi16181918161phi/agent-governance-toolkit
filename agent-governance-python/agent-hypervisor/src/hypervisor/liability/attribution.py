Fault attribution.

Distributes saga-failure liability across the agents whose failed actions
precede the declared failure step, plus a bonus for the direct cause. This is a
deterministic heuristic (failed-action accounting), NOT a game-theoretic Shapley
value: ``agent_actions`` carries no causal-graph edges or timestamps, so actions
are ordered by ``step_id`` (treated as execution order) to decide which failures
are upstream of the failure vs downstream cascade. An optional caller
``risk_weights`` map overrides the heuristic only when it covers every
participating agent.
